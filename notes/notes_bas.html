<p>The language that taught an entire generation to program, BASIC began life
as a compiled language on a timeshare system at Dartmouth. The use of line
numbers for editing betrays its origins on a system with a teletypewriter
interface; there was no screen to use for editing the source. The Microsoft
founders turned it into an interpreter to fit it into the tiny memories of
microcomputers, and for two decades almost every such computer shipped with
BASIC built-in, often as the closest thing they had to an operating system
shell.</p>
