<p>Befunge was created to be an example of a two-dimensional programming
language. That is, while most programs are written in two dimensions, the flow of
execution through the code is linear, generally moving forward through the code
with occasional backward jumps to form loops. The code space for Befunge
is two-dimensional, and execution can move through an instruction travelling
left, right, up, or down. The result is that loops are visible, as in the two
here: the one in the upper right hand corner repeats the whole exercise
500 times, while the one in the lower left loops through the string
outputting characters until hitting the NUL terminator.</p>

<p>Other than its two-dimensionality, Befunge is a Forthlike stack-based
language, operating generally in Reverse Polish Notation. Thus, while the text
to print out is written left-to-right in the code for easy legibility, it is
executed right to left; the NUL terminator is pushed onto the stack first, the
"I" last. But all "words" in Funge are single characters, including digits, so
another interesting feature is the use of character literals for numeric values
greater than 9: here we use "{" for its ASCII value of 125, with the expression
<tt>"{" 4 *</tt> to put 500 on the stack.</p>
