<p>Batsh was created to serve as a common scripting language for both POSIX and
Windows, as it is transpiled to either the Bourne-Again Shell or the language
of Windows BATch files (<b>COMMAND.COM</b>/<b>.EXE</b>). It was a nice idea,
but mostly obviated by, among other things, the creation of PowerShell,
which not only runs on both operating systems but far outstrips the original
Windows command shell in terms of capabilities.
