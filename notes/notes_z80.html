<p>The <tt>org 0100h</tt> statement begins assembly at the standard entry point
for code executed from the CP/M command shell, hexadecimal 0100/decimal 256.
The EQUates set up the system call to print a string, <tt>putstr</tt>. Under
CP/M, syscalls are executed by loading register C with the call's id and then
jumping to the BDOS subroutine; that subroutine is at address 5, and the
identifier for <tt>putstr</tt> is 9.</p>

<p>The Z80 has 16-bit instructions, but there isn't a 16-bit version of DJNZ
(Decrement and Jump if Not Zero), which is the fastest way to loopl So we
handle the 16-bittedness manually with two 8-bit registers, namely B and C.
Normally, when B and C are used together to hold a 16-bit value, B is the high
byte and C the low, and the joint register is called BC. But DJNZ only
operates on B, and we want to use it for the more-frequently-decremented low
byte. So we flip things around and store the high part of the counter in C; I
guess we're using the "CB" register. In order to initialize it efficiently we
use the BC load command with the byte-reversed version of our counter value,
F402 instead of 02F4.</p>

<p>You might notice that hex 02F4 is decimal 756, not 500; the high byte is too
high by one.  That's because the loop takes advantage of a small optimization
when repeating a number of times that requires two registers. The loop logic
consists of decrementing the low half, and jumping to the top of the loop
if that's not zero. If it is zero, it then decrements the high half, and jumps
to the top of the loop if <i>that</i>'s not zero. This lets us use condition
flags with no explicit compares, and no resetting of the low byte; we just let
it wrap naturally. But the  approach means that when the number of iterations
is not an exact multiple of 256, the high byte must be incremented before
entering the loop. 

(The other caveat is that the counter value is not directly usable, since it
will jump around a bit, e.g. going from 0201 to 0100 to 01ff. But in this case
we don't care about the value on each iteration, only the number of iterations,
which will be correct.)</p>
