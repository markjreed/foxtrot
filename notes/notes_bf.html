<p>Brainfuck is a Turing tarpit language; it has the minimal amount of power to
qualify as Turing-complete, and that's it. Execution operates on a virtual memory
tape of one-byte cells with a single read/write head that can move along the tape.
It does have stream-based I/O, which is not found on a pure Turing machine; this
removes the necessity to set up the contents of the tape before execution or
read those contents afterward. The tape always starts with nothing but zeroes,
and its contents at the end of a run are discarded, so the program must
explicitly output anything it wishes to communicate with the outside world.</p>

<p>There are eight instructions, which move the head left and right one space,
increment or decrement the current cell by one, form a conditionally-repeated
block of code, or read or write one character. The conditional/repeat construct
is particularly elegant: the <tt>[</tt> and <tt>]</tt> instructions must form
matching pairs, or the program is rejected as invalid. When execution reaches a
<tt>[</tt>, it checks the current cell; if the value is zero, it skips over
everything until it reaches the matching <tt>]</tt> and then resumes execution
with the instruction after it. If the value is nonzero, however, it continues
with the next instruction. When execution reaches a <tt>]</tt>, it the current
value is checked again with the reverse consequences: it continues onward if
it's zero, but jumps back to the instruction after the matching <tt>[</tt> if
not.</p>

<p>Since a cell is only one byte wide, it can't hold the number 500, so we will
instead loop 250 times twice. A more severe restriction is the lack of
any provision for loading literals into memory; the program must construct
all the values we need, including the character codes for the string to
be printed, by incrementing cells up from zero. Doing so comprises the
bulk of the program; the actual printing of the string, once constructed,
consists of the loop <tt>[.&gt;]</tt>, which outputs the current cell's
value as a character, moves right, and repeats until it finds a zero.</p>
