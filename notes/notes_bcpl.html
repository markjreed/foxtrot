<p>Created by Martin Richards at the University of Cambridge, BCPL was an
evolution of the Cambridge Programming Language (CPL). Richards designed it to
be easier to write a compiler for (by "removing those features of the full
language which make compilation difficult") and thus dubbed it "Bootstrap CPL",
or BCPL for short.</p>

<p>An iteration of same simplification process that turned CPL into BCPL was
later applied to BCPL itself by Ken Thompson to create B, stripped down even
further to run on the limited resources of minicomputers like the PDP-11.
Despite the syntactic differences, the basic operation of B and BCPL are quite
similar, including the "everything's just a word" approach to values. (You'll
note that <tt>count</tt> does not have to be declared here, but springs into
existence upon first reference.)</p>
