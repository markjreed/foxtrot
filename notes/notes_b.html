<p>B is the direct predecessor of C, the language of Jason's original code in
the comic strip; the similarities are rather apparent. Where C is very flexible
with its types, B (like its predecessor BCPL) is totally typeless; all
variables hold machine words, which can be treated as integers, addresses, or
collections of text characters. Nonetheless, it does have variable declarations,
which specify the type of storage to use; <tt>extrn</tt> for symbols that come from
outside libraries, <tt>static</tt> for globals, and <tt>auto</tt> for local
symbols that go into the surrounding procedure's activation record on the
stack.</p>
