<p>This is an example of an older version of COBOL, specifically Abacus COBOL for
the Commodore 64, which despite coming out in 1984 is based  on the original
1959-1960 version of the language, not COBOL-74. As a result it does not have
<tt>PERFORM</tt> loops, so the looping here is done manually with a conditional
<tt>GO TO</tt>. On the other hand, that means <tt>COUNT</tt> is not a reserved word, so
we can use the same variable name as Jason.</p>

<p>The line numbers are an artifact of the line-based editing system, which is the same
one used by BASIC on the machine. Unlike BASIC, the line numbers don't double as
labels; a line must be explicitly labeled, as <tt>LOOP</tt> is here, in order to serve
as the target of a <tt>GO TO</tt>.
