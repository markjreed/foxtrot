<p>Created by and named for Alfred Aho, Peter Weinberger, and Brian Kernighan
(of Kernighan and Ritchie fame), AWK was the first scripting language for UNIX
that wasn't just the command shell with some programming features tacked on. It uses
a fairly elegant dispatch system consisting of (condition, block) pairs; the condition
is checked against each line of input and the corresponding block executed if it's true.
A block without a condition is always executed; a condition without a block just prints
the current line back out.</p>

<p>Since the current application has no input, we use the special condition <tt>BEGIN</tt>;
the attached block is run before any input is read. Since there are no other conditions,
the program exits after the <tt>BEGIN</tt> block finishes. Since the general syntax of AWK was
lifted from C, the resulting program is rather similar to Jason's original.</p>
