Translations of Jason Fox's C code from the Foxtrot strip. Mostly written by
me; even the implementations that originally came from other contributors in the early
days of the project have been subsequently rewritten by me, and therefore any bugs
contained therein should be considered entirely my fault.

That said, a few of those early contributors are these folks:

  David Lane (Postscript, APL)
  Bill LeFebvre (Troff)
